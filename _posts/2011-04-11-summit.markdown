I'm attending the [Summit at Sea](https://sea.summit.co/), part of the Summit Series.

Plenty of sessions, one-on-one, and even some shark tagging with our partners at the University of Miami.

> 1000 attendees including Sir Richard Branson, Peter Diamandis (X Prize Foundation), Jared Cohen (Google), Peter Thiel (The Founders Fund), Russell Simmons, Blake Mycoskie (Tom’s Shoes), Gary V and artist Peter Tunney set sail yesterday from Miami, Florida to embark on a 3-day entrepreneur “schmooze cruise” hosted by Summit Series. Aside from top-shelf schmoozing, the “Summit at Sea” will focus on saving our oceans, a cause near and dear to Sir Branson’s heart (and wallet) after launching Virgin Oceanic this week. Attendees will collaborate with leading scientists, explorers, and conservationists to understand and address the challenges facing our current oceanic ecosystem.
