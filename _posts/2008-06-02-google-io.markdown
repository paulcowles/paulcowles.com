Last week I was fortunate enough to take in the GoogleIO conference in San Francisco. This was google&#8217;s first developer conference &#8211; a quick 2 day event. As you can see from the photo, the event was well attended. Some take-aways from this past week:


- GWT really should be evaluated on any project with aggressive javascript/ajax use.
- Translation API mixed with crowdsourced editing is a very interesting global strategy
- Steve Souders is diving deep into performance bottlenecks and his presentations are must reads.
- Storage API coming soon to google maps allows you to free your user generated geodata, allowing it be found more easily via google search.
- Android, running on hardware similar to iphone, with streetview maps and overlays would really solve the local promotions/coupon problem
- Still no gdata access to search Youtube via geo. Having this for Picassa might actually take some market share from flickr.
- Google Gears makes me want to find a problem that needs offline access as part of the solution.
- Once they crack facebook, there will only be one choice: opensocial
- The visualization api has a number of interesting components &#8211; intensity maps with events would really come in handy
