A few weeks ago, I attended [New York Entrepreneur Week](http://www.nyew.org/) and [Web 2.0 Expo](http://www.web2expo.com/webexny2009/) in New York City. The most interesting highlight was the live twitter stream broadcast behind the keynote speakers at the Web 2.0 Expo. It really took conference talks to the next level in terms of real-time conversation happening between the entire audience. Peter Shankman was quite funny at the NYEW.
